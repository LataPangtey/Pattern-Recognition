# Deep Learning Architecture
We propose an emotion-aware dual cross-attentive neural network with label fusion for stance detection for stance detection. By recognizing that affective features can shape frameworks and responses, the method aims to enhance the understanding of emotions in stances. We devise a dual cross-attention mechanism for the input texts, followed by a hierarchical attention network to capture inter and intra-relationships. This helps in identifying the important parts of both the source and reply texts. To explore impact of emotional alignment of source-reply text on stance, we incorporate the emotions expressed in both the source and reply texts, in our method.
